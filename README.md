# Functional view

##### C++-based script that analyzes 5G NR (vRAN) call-related log data file (.txt) content and derives common Network KPIs from them.
##### The script is designed to support network operator analyzing 5G base station call quality
##### The script calculates the following KPIs:

 	•	RRC Setup Success Rate, HARQ ACK Success Rate (DL), Average PDCP Uplink SDU Size, Average SINR, Average RSRP, Average RSRQ, Average MCS, Average Resource Blocks and CQI Distribution

##### The script is helping to identify these common problems in 5G Systems:

##### 1. Radio Network Level (Typical Causes)

##### a. Coverage Holes / Interference
	•	Caused by physical obstructions, weather, or misaligned antennas.
	•	Often localized and can be seen with spike patterns in certain cells.

#### b. Handover Failures
	•	If X2/N2 handover fails due to bad target cell config or signaling issues.
	•	Sudden drop in mobility success + spike in drops.

#### c. Timing Issues
	•	TA (Timing Advance) misconfigurations leading to RLF (Radio Link Failure).
	•	May relate to incorrect synchronization with GPS/1588 clocks.

#### d. Excessive Load / Resource Congestion
	•	PRB (Physical Resource Block) exhaustion.
	•	High UE density with insufficient scheduling capacity or license limits.

#### e. HARQ/NACK Issues
	•	HARQ processes failing due to bad link adaptation or interference.
	•	Low DL BLER + drop spike can be a hint.

⸻

#### 2. Core Network / Interface Issues

Less common, but worth checking during area-wide spikes.

#### a. Session Management Fails (SMF/UPF)
	•	If PDU session fails mid-call, the drop appears to radio as an RLF.
	•	Look at NG-C signaling failures (N2 interface).

#### b. AMF Paging or Registration Rejection
	•	If mobility is blocked due to identity mismatch or TAC issues.

⸻

#### 3. Server/Software-Level Causes (on the gNB side)

#### a. Memory Cache Exhaustion or Leaks
	•	TCP/IP stack buffer issues, EPC anchor process leak, or bad LRU policies.
	•	Often seen with slowly building issues until sudden tipping point.

#### b. Thread Starvation or Core Overload
	•	gNB processing threads over-allocated or stuck (like RRC or MAC threads).
	•	High context switch rate, high core temperature, or stuck mutexes.

#### c. gNB Application or FAPI Driver Fault
	•	Abnormal behavior from PHY/MAC interface (via FAPI/IFx).
	•	Related to real-time scheduling or DPDK-related drops.

⸻

#### 4. Transport / Backhaul Issues
	•	High latency, jitter, or packet loss between DU and CU.
	•	Common in split option 7.x or 2 when fronthaul is not guaranteed low-latency.

⸻

#### 5. Software Upgrade/Config Anomalies
	•	Bad config pushed via EMS (wrong PCI/TA/NRARFCN).
	•	Incomplete restart after upgrade, e.g., partial component active.
